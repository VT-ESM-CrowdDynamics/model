{"name":"VT-ESM-CrowdDynamics","tagline":"opensource agent-based model for crowd modelling","body":"2014-VTESM-Crowd_Model\r\n======================\r\n\r\nThis is an opensource agent-based model for crowd modelling.\r\nThis code should run in GNU Octave, and the analysis program (datareader.m) even\r\nworks in MATLAB. The most current development, as far as force functions, is in\r\nthe model-prototype branch. There is a parallel version in progress on\r\nnewpattern, but it presently has a critical bug in the goal force helper.\r\n\r\nThe experimental data, from Qualisys Track Manager, is available\r\n[here](http://goo.gl/YM2Z22), and the final paper on this project is available\r\n[here](http://goo.gl/L2YuRC).\r\n\r\nOctave can be downloaded for Windows from several\r\n[locations](http://wiki.octave.org/Octave_for_Microsoft_Windows), but the Cygwin\r\nversion is presently recommended as the parallel package should be buildable,\r\nwhich is required for newpattern. Otherwise, or if turning off parallel in the\r\nconfiguration, the MXE Build should be fine.\r\n\r\nAfter downloading and extracting the archive, or cloning the repo, the model can\r\nbe run with or by modifying the demo script in the model directory. This will be\r\na bat file on Windows, or an sh file on OSX/Linux/Cygwin. It requires Octave to\r\nbe in the path. For Windows, add C:\\Octave\\Octave-[version]\\bin\r\n([see this](http://windowsitpro.com/systems-management/how-can-i-add-new-folder-my-system-path)).\r\n\r\nThe model can be adjusted by changing parameters in the demo script, and in the\r\nforce functions and engine M files.\r\n","google":"UA-55416028-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
